# RunHiddenConsole
Created executable can be renamed to powershellw.exe or pwshw.exe (or any other console-flashing-window) and put next to the corresponding assembly. Calls to the added assembly will be sent to a new instance of the target assembly, which is explicitly started without creating a window. Thus these flashing windows should be avoided.
# Future Points
Input stream from file and output stream to file, if requested.
    Please tell me how you would like to use this. It would probably require a config file alongside the assembly to configure which parameters define the inputs and outputs
